  bio:
    'Spencer Lee Tiberi was born on March 29th, 1991 in Sparks, Nevada. However, he spent most of his life in Las Vegas. Spencer grew up in the southwestern Las Vegas suburb of Enterprise, frequently alternating between exploring his desert habitat and venturing into virtual worlds on his Nintendo 64. As a fun juxtaposition to Las Vegas summers, he started snowboarding at the age of 8. After a high school experience spent dabbling in creating music and playing bass guitar, Spencer graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in 2013 with a BS in Secondary Education - Mathematics and a minor in Psychology. He quickly jumped into teaching Mathematics at Mojave High School in North Las Vegas and later at Durango High School closer to his home in Enterprise. After four years of teaching in his hometown, Spencer graduated from Harvard Extension School with a Master of Liberal Arts in Mathematics for Teaching and moved out to the Boston area to teach Computer Science at Belmont Hill School utilizing Harvard’s CS50 curriculum. He now works as an Engineering Manager at Harvard, helping undergrads develop web and mobile apps for entrepreneurial clients. To this day, he still plays bass guitar, snowboards, plays video games, and explores his habitat (desert or otherwise).',
